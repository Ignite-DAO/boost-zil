# boost-zil
are you tired of writing 500 lines of code to make a tx to the zilliqa blockchain? Welcome

## Quick start

```bash
npm i boost-zil@latest -g
```

```bash
mkdir myProject && boost-zil-project
```

✨ Congrats ✨ it is that simple.

You just created a scilla dev project that can build your contract, and test it on an isolated ziliqa blockchain server.

Read through the code and get started!
